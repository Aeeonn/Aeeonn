# Hi, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for hands-on projects, motorcycles, and technology.  
I love bringing ideas to life, whether that's through programming, tinkering with hardware, or building things outdoors.

## ðŸ’» Skills & Interests

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C, Java, Verilog  
- **Web:** Mild knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- **Hardware:** FPGA design and digital systems  
- **Hobbies:** Motorcycling, outdoor adventures, and spending time with friends

## ðŸš¦ Featured Project: FPGA Reaction Game

I'm currently working on a reaction-based game implemented entirely on an FPGA using Verilog.  
The project is a test of reflexesâ€”press the button as soon as the LED lights up!  
Iâ€™ll be uploading the code, schematics, and demo soon.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Up To

- Always learning new tech and engineering skills
- Building fun projects that combine hardware and software
- Exploring the world on two wheels when Iâ€™m not coding
